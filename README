LibreOffice on-line.

This project fundamentally has two pieces:

loolwsd/
	The server side component.

loleaflet/
	The client side component.

First compile loolwsd, and then loleaflet.

Since you need both of these to get things working, it is recommended
to read the READMEs in both projects.

Enjoy.
