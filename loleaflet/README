Loading a document:
    The map should have the following options:
        - bounds = top left [0, 0] and something larger in the bottom right corner which
          will later be updated 
        - center at [0, 0] this will try to place the [0, 0] point in the middle of the
          map, but it will be moved in the top left corner when the maxBounds are set
        - zoom = defautl zoom value, zooming in and out will refer to this value
        - server address

    The layer (actual document) should have the following options:
        - doc = path to the document that will be loaded
        - useSocket = tells the map the tiles will be received from a websocket
          connection. If this parameter is false, an image will be loaded in each tile

To run an example, open debug/document/document_simple_example.html in the browser
