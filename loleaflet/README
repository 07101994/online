Leaflet paltform for LibreOffice On-Line 

Code convention
    * 'jake lint' should be run before commiting
    * files should have unix line terminators (LF)
    * tools to convert files: dos2unix or fromdos 

Building:
    unzip node_modules/modules.zip -d node_modules
    *** OR ***
    npm install -g jake
    npm install
    *** THEN ***
    jake build
    cd plugins/draw-0.2.4
    jake build

If you want to avoid having to run the above as root, create a directory that
you own somehwere, for instance /opt/npm, and add a line to ~/.npmrc:
prefix=/opt/npm

Loading a document:
    The map should have the following options:
        - bounds = top left [0, 0] and something larger in the bottom right corner which
          will later be updated 
        - center at [0, 0] this will try to place the [0, 0] point in the middle of the
          map, but it will be moved in the top left corner when the maxBounds are set
        - zoom = defautl zoom value, zooming in and out will refer to this value
        - server address

    The layer (actual document) should have the following options:
        - doc = path to the document that will be loaded
        - useSocket = tells the map the tiles will be received from a websocket
          connection. If this parameter is false, an image will be loaded in each tile

How zooming works:
    The zoom level goes from 1 to 20 (thoes limits can be changed) and the initial
    level is 10, which represents the 100% zoom level. 9 = 90%, 11 = 110% and so on.

Controls are added above the map in a div called "controls" is intended to be used as a toolbar.
There is no leaflet method of adding them in a separte div, so for now this is done in the html
document after the map initialization.

To run an example, open debug/document/document_simple_example.html in the browser
