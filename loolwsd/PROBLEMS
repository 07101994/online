- There is way too much of busy waiting for fairly arbitrarily chosen
  timeout periods in the code.

- Recursive mutexes are evil. In general, I think the consensus is
  that recursive mutexes should be avoided. One should use them only
  when absolutely necessary because the code-base is so complex that
  one has no idea how it works. That was hopefully not the case when
  recursive mutexes were introduced here? But probably it is by now...

- Occasionally Control-C (SIGINT) doesn't shut fown loolwsd. One has
  to kill it with SIGKILL. Which of course leaves all the chroot jails
  around.

- ASCII art? Seriously?
