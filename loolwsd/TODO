- Make child processes time out and go away when inactive for a while.

- Make the "load" request actually take an URL, not a file name. (But
  for now would always be a file: URL, sure.)

- Get rid of the CHROOT capability after using it

- Investigate using "bind" mounts, remounted read-only, to set up the
  chroot jail, instead of requiring the "sys" template tree to
  traverse and hardlink into the jail.

- Investigate using "seccomp". Not available in the Linux 3.7.10 in
  openSUSE 12.3 for instance, though.

- Add some intentional slowdown option to emulate slow network
  connection.
