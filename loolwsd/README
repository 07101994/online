LibreOffice On-Line WebSocket server

See protocol.txt for a description of the protocol to be used over the
websocket.

Uses libpng and the Poco library, from
http://pocoproject.org/index.html. Build it with ./configure
--prefix=/opt/poco && make install. Probably is available packaged in
some distros

At least I like the Poco library. But if it is not acceptable for some
reason, please scream quickly, before too much code that uses Poco has
been written... I found Poco while looking for code to do the
WebSocket handshake and marshalling. But that functionality is just a
small part of what Poco does.

This uses autofoo so build like this:

autoreconf
automake --add-missing
./configure --enable-debug --enable-silent-rules --with-lokit-path=<...>/include --with-poco-includes=<..>./include --with-poco-libs=<...>/lib
make

For Windows, a proper VS2013 project is needed.

See SOW for the directions of further work.

Also there is unconditional debugging output etc.

Run loolwsd for instance like this to test:

(echo load foo.odt; echo tile width=500 height=500 tileposx=0 tileposy=0 tilewidth=10000 tileheight=10000; sleep 10) | 
    ./loolwsd --lopath=<...>/instdir/program --test

The handling of termination is a bit fragile, occasionally it dumps
core somewhere in LO code when quitting. Don't be scared.
