LibreOffice On-Line WebSocket server

See protocol.txt for a description of the protocol to be used over the
websocket.

Uses libpng and the Poco library, from
http://pocoproject.org/index.html. Build it with ./configure
--prefix=/opt/poco && make install. Probably is available packaged in
some distros

At least I like the Poco library. But if it is not acceptable for some
reason, please scream quickly, before too much code that uses Poco has
been written... I found Poco while looking for code to do the
WebSocket handshake and marshalling. But that functionality is just a
small part of what Poco does.

This uses autofoo now: autoreconf, run ./configure with appropriate
--with-lokit-path, --with-poco-includes and --with-poco-libs options,
make.

For Windows, a proper VS2013 project is needed.

For now this is intentionally just serving one client once. (This is
what the SOW says we should do first. See SOW for the directions of
further work.)

Also there is unconditional debugging output etc.

Run loolwsd for instance like this to test:

(echo load foo.odt; echo tile width=500 height=500 tileposx=0 tileposy=0 tilewidth=10000 tileheight=10000) | ./loolwsd --lopath=<path-to-lo-builddir>/instdir/program --test

The handling of termination is a bit fragile, occasionally it dumps
core somewhere in LO code when quitting. Don't be scared.

Set the DUMPPNG env var and the code dumps PNGs sent for each tile requests to a FOO<n>.png.
