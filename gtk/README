This is a GTK+ Webkit app that is intended to work siilar enough to
the iOS app that problems in that also show up in this app, and can be
fixed by people with no Mac or iOS device.

How to build this:

Use a separate tree of "online". Do NOT use one where you build a
normal Online.

Run autogen.sh, then configure:

./configure --disable-ssl --enable-gtkapp --with-lo-path=/home/tml/lo/cp-6.0/instdir --with-lokit-path=/home/tml/lo/cp-6.0/include

Obviously, adjust the path to your LibreOffice build tree as necessary.

Then make.

You will get the gtk/mobile executable. Run it. Debug it. Fix it.
