How to build the iOS app:

1) First you need to build the LibreOffice core code for iOS. Put in
your autogen.input something like this:

--enable-debug
--enable-dbgutil
--enable-werror
--without-parallelism
--disable-ccache
--with-distro=LibreOfficeiOS

and build "normally". (Naturally, no unit tests will be run when
cross-compiling LibreOffice.)

This will produce a large number of static archives (.a) here and
there in instdir and workdir, but no app that can be run as such. (You
can see a list of them in
workdir/CustomTarget/ios/ios-all-static-libs.list)

2) Do a separate clone of the online repo on macOS, but don't run any
make or open the Mobile project there yet.

3) Then, in a separate clone of the online repo on Linux, configure it with the --enable-iosapp option:

./configure --disable-ssl --enable-iosapp --with-lo-path=/home/tml/lo/fedora/instdir --with-lokit-path=/home/tml/lo/fedora/include

(The --with-lo-path and --with-lokit-path options are actually
irrelevant, but needed anyway.)

Then run make. That will produce files in loleaflet/dist, nothing
else. Copy those to the corresponding directory in the online close
from step 2. This is what I do:

make clean && make && tar cf - loleaflet/dist | ssh misan.local 'cd lo/online-ios-device && tar xvf -'

where misan.local is the macOS machine where I build the app, in the
lo/online-ios-device folder.

4) In the online folder form step 2, edit the
Mobile/Mobile.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj file in your favourite text
editor.

Change all instances of ../../../../ios-device to the path to where
you build LibreOffice core for iOS from step 1. Change the value of
PNGINSTDIR to where you have installed libpng compiled for iOS. Change
POCOINSTDIR to where you have installed Poco compiled for iOS.

4) Now you can open the Mobile Xcode project, build it, and run it.
